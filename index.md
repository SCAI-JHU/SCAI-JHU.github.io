<!-- # Website for the Social Cognitive AI (SCAI) lab at Johns Hopkins University -->

Welcome to the website for the Social Cognitive AI (SCAI) Lab at Johns Hopkins University. The lab is led by Dr. <a href="https://www.tshu.io/">Tianmin Shu</a>. Our goal is to advance human-centered AI by engineering machine social intelligence to build socially intelligent systems that can understand, reason about, and interact with humans in real-world settings. We work at the intersection of Embodied AI, Machine Learning, and Computational Social Cognition.
