We are actively recruiting highly motivated students to join our lab.

### Prospective PhD students

Due to the volume of messages, I cannot respond to individual inquiries. Please apply directly to the JHU Computer Science PhD program and mention my name as a prospective advisor. If your research interests closely align with our lab’s focus and you would like to discuss your application, please email me using the subject line that starts with [SCAI PHD APP].
