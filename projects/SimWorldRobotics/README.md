## Start using the template
To start using the template click on `Use this Template`.

The template uses html for controlling the content and css for controlling the style. 
To edit the websites contents edit the `index.html` file. It contains different HTML "building blocks", use whichever ones you need and comment out the rest.  

**IMPORTANT!** Make sure to replace the `favicon.ico` under `static/images/` with one of your own, otherwise your favicon is going to be a dreambooth image of me.

## What's New

## Customization

The HTML file has TODO comments showing what to replace:

- Links (arXiv, GitHub, etc.)
- Abstract and descriptions  
- Videos, images, and PDFs
- Related works in the dropdown
- Meta tags for SEO and social sharing

### Meta Tags
The template includes meta tags for better search engine visibility and social media sharing. These appear in the `<head>` section and help with:

Create a 1200x630px social preview image at `static/images/social_preview.png`.
